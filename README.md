# Polygon States

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/chrispyles/polygon-states/master?filepath=notebooks)

This repository contains some experimentations I have to done to practice algorithmic thinking and computational geometry on polygons. The states are used as an interesting backdrop because they provide a variety of polygons from simple to complex that allow me to road-test the algorithms that I am writing. The data comes from [http://econym.org.uk/gmap/states.xml](http://econym.org.uk/gmap/states.xml). 

The notebooks are numbered so that they can be viewed in order, beginning with reformatting the data from XML to CSV.
